# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-15)

**Core value:** You can see at a glance which of your many Claude Code sessions needs you next — and act on it — whether at the terminal or on your phone.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — Full Status-Line Capture

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (Full Status-Line Capture) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 3
Status: Phase complete — ready for verification
Last activity: 2026-06-15 -- Plan 01-01 complete

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 33%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Recent decisions affecting current work (full log in PROJECT.md Key Decisions):

- v0.7: GSD-track baude starting at v0.7 (lean scaffold, no full re-interview)
- v0.7: Prefer first-party Claude data (status-line JSON, hooks) over inference
- v0.7: Local hook transport via per-session event files; HTTP only in the daemon
- v0.7: Permission-prompt mode is opt-in; `skip` stays default
- 01-01: Bridge writer factored into testable `build_bridge(v: &Value) -> Value`; reads `session_id` internally so the fn is total (no panic on minimal payload)
- 01-01: Keep `serde_json::Value` accessors (no `#[derive(Deserialize)]`, no branching on `schema`) — this is the STL-02 back-compat guarantee
- 01-01: `vim_mode` is captured/persisted but never rendered (capture-but-don't-render)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2 (hooks) must tolerate Claude Code hook schema drift and never clobber user settings.json — same care as `bridge.rs::window()` and the statusLine seeding path.
- Web Push (v0.5) is not yet phone-verified; Phase 4's distinct permission push depends on a working push path.
